## Perception
A nuron network that changes with "experience" using an error-correction rule.

Weight of a neuron changes when it makes **error response** to the input presented to the network

- One layer of inputs
- One layer of outputs
The two layers are fully interconnected.

Semantically, a *perceptron* can be considered as a vector-valued function that maps the input `a = {a0, a1,..., an}` to the output `X = {X1, X2, ..., Xm}`, allows **real inputs**

Each output neuron has the same inputs, which the total input layer, while each individual outputs are with **individual connections** and therefore have **different weights** of connections

The weighted input to the j-th output neuron
$$S_{j} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} w_{ij} a_{i}$$
$\color{aqua}{a_{0}}$ is a
