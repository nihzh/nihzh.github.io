- Imperative programming language
	- C, C++, Java, Python, PHP......
	- A list of instructions to the computer
- Functional programming language
	- *Haskell*, a pure functional language
	- More **methemetical**
	- Functional programming is **a style of programming**
	- No variables, No loops, No excplict idea of a sequence of instructions, Uses recursion
- A fectorial question:
	- Imperative: declare variables, around a loop, execute one each time.
	- Functional: no variables, no explicit looping (using recursion)
- complex algorithms are mostly functional
- function is a balckbox, put few falues in and
- Pure functions **only** influence the world through **return values** -- No changes global state, printing, connect netwoks.....
- Pure functions must be **deterministic**, no random contents
- same input, always same output.
- one function do one thing only.
- No control flow, everything is juct function application
- IO function has side-effect, call by pure functions

- Interpreter "ghci"
- True False, Capital sensitive
- Boolean expressions: && || not
- Equalities: == /=(not equal)
- Inequalities: < > <= >=
- Brackets: () bind the elements
- Evaluating: min, max
- div: integer; /: float; mod
- commas-->spaces `<function_name>[<space><attr1>[<space><attr2>]]`
- \`\` infix operator
- () outfix operator
- -- comment; {- multiple line comment -}
- `:load func.hs` load the module
- `:r` read the module loaded
- Camel case usually
- the default module name: Main, use `module <name> where` at the beginning of the file to define it.
