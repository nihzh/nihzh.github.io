### Agents
Agents are objects with **attitude**, do for **personal gain**
- Autonomous
- Smart
- Active: inherently multi-threated

*Expert Systems*: capable of solving problems or giving advice in some knowledge-righ domain
- inherently disembodied

Environments
- Fully observable vs. partially
	- agent can obtain complete, accurate, up-to-date infor mation about the environment state
- deterministic vs. non-deterministic
	- any action has a single guaranteed effect
	- the physical world can to all intents and purposes be regarded as non-deterministic
- static vs. dynamic
	- remain unchanged except by the rperformance of actions by the agent
	- has other processed operating on it, and which hence changes in ways beyond the agent's control
- discrete vs. continuous
- episodic vs. non-episodic(sequential)
	- episodic: each state is independent of each other, current action will  not affedct a future action
	- the current decision affects future decisions
- Real time: time plays a curcial part in evaluating an agent's performance

#### Intelligent agents
- *reactive* (encironment aware): maintains an **ongoing interaction** with its environment, and responds to changes that occur in it
	- perceive and respond in timely fashion to changes
- *pro-active* (goal-driven): generating and attepting to achieve goals; not drivent solely by events; taking the initiative
- *social ability*: we cannot go around attempting to achieve goals without taking other into account
	- *cooperation*: working together as a team to ahcieve a shared goal
	- *coordination*: managing inter-dependencies between the activities of agents, recources\*
	- *negotiation*: the ability to reach agreements on matters of common interest

#### Intentional Systems
Having some mental states
- physical stance
- design stance
- intentional stance

> whose behaviour can be predicted by the method of attributing belief, desires and retional acumen

- First-order intentional system: 
	- desires and beliefs
	- no desires and beliefs of desires and beliefs
- Second-order intentional system:
	- has desires and beliefs of desires and beliefs (own)
	- no doubt other intentional states

***low level explainations become impractical***

Intentional stance description useful to understand
- strucure of the machine
- part or future behaviour
- how to repair or improve it
- explain and predict a complex system's behaviour without having to unserstand how the machanism actually works

### Abstract Architectures
![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020250203173527.png)

#### Runs
$R$ be the set of all such possible finite sequences (E and Ac)
$R^{Ac}$ be the subset of these that end with an action
$R^{E}$ be the subset of these that end with an environment state

$r, r', ...$ to represent the members of $R$

#### Environments
The effect that an agent's actions have on an environment
$$\tau : R^{Ac} \rightarrow 2^E$$
- History dependent: the next state not only dependent ont the actino of the agent, but earlier actions may be dignificant
- Non-deterministic: some uncertainty about the result of an action
$\tau(r)=\Phi$ : There are no possile successor states to `r`, the run has ended, then `Env` is a triple
$$Env=<E,e_0,\tau>$$
Where `E` is a set of states, $\color{#b293f6}e_0\in E$ is an initial state, and $\tau$ is a state transformer function 

#### Agents
A function which map runs to actions
$$Ag:R^E \rightarrow Ac$$
##### Purely Reactive Agents
- do without reference to their history
- base their decision making entirely on the present

#### Systems
A pair containing an agent and an environment
Any system will have associated with it a set of possible runs
$$R(Ag,Env)$$

#### Perception
`see` represents the agent's ability to obtain information from its environment. The agent has soome initernal data structure, which is typically used to record information about the environment state and history
$$see:E\rightarrow Per$$

#### Next state functions
`I` be the set of all internal states of the agent

![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020250204172726.png)

#### Utility functions
- Associate **rewards** with states that we what agensts to bring about
- Associate **utilities** with individual states
	- The utility of a state is a numberic value representing how good a state is
	- The task fo the agent is then to bring about states that maximise utility
$$u:E\rightarrow\mathrm{R}$$
##### Local utility functions


#### Expected utitility
The probability that run `r` occurs when agent `Ag` is placed in environment `Env` $$P(r|Ag,Env)$$
can be computed from the probability of each step
![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020250204174153.png)

Expected utility `EU` of agent `Ag` in environment `Env` (`P`, `u`)
$$EU(Ag,Env)=\sum_{r\in R(Ag,Env)}u(r)P(r|Ag,Env)$$

#### Optimal agents
![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020250204173645.png)

#### Predicate Task Spacifications
A special case of assigneing utilities to histories is to assign 0 or 1 to a run, denote $\Psi$
![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020250210171204.png)

#### Task environments
$$<Env, \Psi>$$
- The properties of the system the agent will inhabit
- The criteria by which an agent will be judged to have either failed or succeeded in its task

A set of all runs of the agent in an environment that satisfy $\Psi$
$$R_\Psi(Ag,Env)=\{r|r\in R(Ag,Env)\space and\space\Psi(r)=1\}$$

An agnet `Ag` succeeds in task environment $<Env,\Psi>$

#### Achivement and Maintenance Task
The idea of a predicate task
- achievement tasks: achive state of affairs $\varphi$
- maintanance tasks: maintain state of affairs $\varPsi$

## Deductive Reasoning Agents
### Symbolic Reasoning Agents
Agents make decisions about what to do via *symbol manipulation*
- knowledge-based system
- bring all the associated methodologies of such systems to bear
### Ractive Agents

To use logic to encode a theory stating the best action to perform in any given situation
- $\color{#b293f6}\Delta$ be a logical database that describes the current internal state of an agent
	- *first-order predicate logic*
- $\color{#b293f6}\rho$ be the theory (tylically a set of deduction rules)
- $\color{#b293f6}Ac$ be the set of actions the agent can perform
- $\color{#b293f6}\Delta\vdash_\rho\varphi$ means that $\color{#b293f6}\varphi$ can be proved from $\color{#b293f6}\Delta$ using $\color{#b293f6}\rho$
