### Agents
Agents are objects with **attitude**, do for **personal gain**
- Autonomous
- Smart
- Active: inherently multi-threated

*Expert Systems*: capable of solving problems or giving advice in some knowledge-righ domain
- inherently disembodied

Environments
- Fully observable vs. partially
	- agent can obtain complete, accurate, up-to-date infor mation about the environment state
- deterministic vs. non-deterministic
	- any action has a single guaranteed effect
	- the physical world can to all intents and purposes be regarded as non-deterministic
- static vs. dynamic
	- remain unchanged except by the rperformance of actions by the agent
	- has other processed operating on it, and which hence changes in ways beyond the agent's control
- discrete vs. continuous
- episodic vs. non-episodic(sequential)
	- episodic: each state is independent of each other, current action will  not affedct a future action
	- the current decision affects future decisions
- Real time: time plays a curcial part in evaluating an agent's performance

#### Intelligent agents
- *reactive* (encironment aware): maintains an **ongoing interaction** with its environment, and responds to changes that occur in it
	- perceive and respond in timely fashion to changes
- *pro-active* (goal-driven): generating and attepting to achieve goals; not drivent solely by events; taking the initiative
- *social ability*: we cannot go around attempting to achieve goals without taking other into account
	- *cooperation*: working together as a team to ahcieve a shared goal
	- *coordination*: managing inter-dependencies between the activities of agents, recources\*
	- *negotiation*: the ability to reach agreements on matters of common interest

#### Intentional Systems
Having some mental states
- physical stance
- design stance
- intentional stance

> whose behaviour can be predicted by the method of attributing belief, desires and retional acumen

- First-order intentional system: 
	- desires and beliefs
	- no desires and beliefs of desires and beliefs
- Second-order intentional system:
	- has desires and beliefs of desires and beliefs (own)
	- no doubt other intentional states

***low level explainations become impractical***

Intentional stance description useful to understand
- strucure of the machine
- part or future behaviour
- how to repair or improve it
- explain and predict a complex system's behaviour without having to unserstand how the machanism actually works

### Abstract Architectures
![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020250203173527.png)

#### Runs
$R$ be the set of all such possible finite sequences (E and Ac)
$R^{Ac}$ be the subset of these that end with an action
$R^{E}$ be the subset of these that end with an environment state

$r, r', ...$ to represent the members of $R$
