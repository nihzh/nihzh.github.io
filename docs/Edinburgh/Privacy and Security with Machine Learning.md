Data acquisition -> Data preparation -> Model training -> Model testing -> Model deployment

Adversaries with ML:
- Automation: lower cost and larger scale
- Synthesis
- Pattern extraction
- Network traffic analysis, Data deanonymisation, Hardware side-channels

Classification of samples ==> threat model extraction
