Bad software: worm, virus
- Potential unwanted Programs: Full programs that provide functionality but **the user may not actually want them**

*Adversaries*
- Malicious actors: could be anyone
- Service providers: company / developers
- Big brother
*Assets*: 
- hardware/software
- physical assets
- information
- emotion, reputation, experience
Risk, *threat* and *vulnerability*
- Risk = asset \* threat \* vulnerability

Gap
- Security updates
- Antivirus software
- Account security: password using
- Mindfulness: unknown links/emails

怎么设计界面/反馈来改变行为

### Biometry
- Physiological: DNA, Faceprint, Heartbeat, Palmprint

## Cookies
*Third party cookie*: large company and public visible, to constrain

Tracked too many things

*User study*
Assess needs
Examine trade-offs
Evaluate
Finding root causes

*Project lifecycle*
