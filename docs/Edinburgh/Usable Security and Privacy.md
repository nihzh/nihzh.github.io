Bad software: worm, virus
- Potential unwanted Programs: Full programs that provide functionality but **the user may not actually want them**

*Adversaries*
- Malicious actors: could be anyone
- Service providers: company / developers
- Big brother
*Assets*: 
- hardware/software
- physical assets
- information
- emotion, reputation, experience
Risk, *threat* and *vulnerability*
- Risk = asset \* threat \* vulnerability

Gap
- Security updates
- Antivirus software
- Account security: password using
- Mindfulness: unknown links/emails
