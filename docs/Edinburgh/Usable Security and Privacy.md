Bad software: worm, virus
- Potential unwanted Programs: Full programs that provide functionality but **the user may not actually want them**

*Adversaries*
- Malicious actors: could be anyone
- Service providers: company / developers
- Big brother
*Assets*: 
- hardware/software
- physical assets
- information
- emotion, reputation, experience
Risk, *threat* and *vulnerability*
- Risk = asset \* threat \* vulnerability

Gap
- Security updates
- Antivirus software
- Account security: password using
- Mindfulness: unknown links/emails

## Authentication
![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020260120202925.png)

- What you have
- What you know
- Who you are

*Multifactor authentication*

*Usable Authentication*
- User friendly
- Reasonable to implement
- Protects against attacks

怎么设计界面/反馈来改变行为

### Biometry
- Physiological: DNA, Faceprint, Heartbeat, Palmprint
- Behavioural: Gait, Keystroke, Voiceprint, Signature

Emerging: Earable, Teeth Interface, Bone Conduction

*Fingerprint*
1. Image acquisition
2. Image processing
3. Minutiae extraction

- Vascular pattern
- Face recognition
- Voice Biometrics
- Hand geometry
- Dynamic signature
- Iris recognition
- Retina recognition

## Cookies
*Third party cookie*: large company and public visible, to constrain

Tracked too many things

*User study*
Assess needs
Examine trade-offs
Evaluate
Finding root causes

*Project lifecycle*

*Usability testing*

*Behavioral* –  measures how people actually behave, what they do.  
*Attitudinal* –  measures what people say they think or how they say they behave
*Qualitative* – unstructured data such as natural language.  
*Quantitative* – numerical data. Anything that can be counted or measured with numbers.

Behavioral & Attitudinal question each

## Survey and Analysis
*Cognitive Walkthrough*: a set of experts review and make an informed guess about what will be problematic
*Lab Study*: ask the participant to perform a set of tasks

### In-place lab user studies
Detailed, how, why

### Questionnaires
- quickly
- how prevalent
- can only gather data you know about

Designing and planning is very important

**Quantitative the values**: *Likert*-Type Scale Response Anchors
- Level of acceptability
- System usability scale

### Planning a survey
#### Descriptive
Learn something about the whole population
- *Descriptive questions*: learn something about the whole population
- *Descriptive numeric*: fancy term for all the basic measures of numeric data
- *Descriptive qualitative*: use data to learn about a whole population

#### Correlation or Causation
Show that two things are related or one thing causes the other thing
- *Correlation*: two things tend to behave in a way that seems inter-related, where if one thing changes the other thing will also change in a related way
- *Causation*: when one thing changes it causes the other ting to change

#### Dependent or Independent
*Dependent*: outcome variable, measures the usability goal
*Independent*
